GameLibrary
===========
This is a very early attempt at a indie game library
that a group of friends and myself plan to add to an refine until we have a game :)

It may take a while for it to be useful, but my hope is that it eventually be 
something that someone can use in any game they make.

Lets see where this goes :)
